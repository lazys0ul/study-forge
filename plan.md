> Long-term goal: A powerful, student-first productivity platform.**# TeamMind: AI-Native Searchable Memory for Teams

## 1. Problem Statement

Teams use multiple platformsâ€”Slack, Google Docs, Notion, GitHub, Driveâ€”leading to scattered knowledge and wasted productivity. Critical information is hard to find, slowing down collaboration and decision-making.

## 2. Solution Overview

TeamMind unifies your teamâ€™s knowledge by integrating with common tools and providing a powerful, chat-based AI search. Ask any question in natural language, and get instant, context-rich answersâ€”no more hunting across tabs.

## 3. Features

- Integrate multiple sources (Slack, Google Docs, more coming soon)
- AI-powered semantic search (not just keywords)
- Modern chat-based UI for asking questions
- Results with rich context: source, author, timestamp, link
- Secure authentication (Google, Slack OAuth)
- Scalable and privacy-respecting

## 4. System Architecture

### Frontend
- Next.js (React), Tailwind CSS
- Chat UI, Results display, OAuth integrations

### Backend
- Node.js/Express (API)
- Embedding generation (OpenAI/Cohere)
- Data importers for Slack & Google Docs

### Storage
- Vector DB (Pinecone/Weaviate/Milvus/FAISS): stores embeddings + metadata
- Postgres/Supabase: user info, source mapping

### Auth
- OAuth (Google, Slack), JWT

## 5. User Flow

1. User connects Slack & Google Docs.
2. System imports and chunks data.
3. AI embeddings generated and stored.
4. User asks a question in chat.
5. Relevant results shown with context.
6. User can filter, refine, or follow-up.
