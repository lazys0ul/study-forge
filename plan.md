## 1. Problem Statement

Teams use multiple platforms—Slack, Google Docs, Notion, GitHub, Drive—leading to scattered knowledge and wasted productivity. Critical information is hard to find, slowing down collaboration and decision-making.

## 2. Solution Overview

## 3. Features

- Integrate multiple sources (Slack, Google Docs, more coming soon)
- AI-powered semantic search (not just keywords)
- Modern chat-based UI for asking questions
- Results with rich context: source, author, timestamp, link
- Secure authentication (Google, Slack OAuth)
- Scalable and privacy-respecting

## 4. System Architecture

### Frontend
- Next.js (React), Tailwind CSS
- Chat UI, Results display, OAuth integrations

### Backend
- Node.js/Express (API)
- Embedding generation (OpenAI/Cohere)
- Data importers for Slack & Google Docs

### Storage

- Postgres/Supabase: user info, source mapping

### Auth
- OAuth (Google, Slack), JWT

## 5. User Flow

1. User connects Slack & Google Docs.
2. System imports and chunks data.
3. AI embeddings generated and stored.
4. User asks a question in chat.
